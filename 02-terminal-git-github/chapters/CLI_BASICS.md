## Practice: Yellow Brick Code Directory &amp; Files

Before you start writing code for any application, you want to set up the directory structure, and create some initial files. One of our first projects is to build a web page for Yellow Brick Code.

All of the work you will be doing at NSS will be contained in the `~/workspace` directory. Inside of the `workspace` directory, you need to create an `martins-aquarium` subdirectory.

```sh
{home directory}
    +-- workspace
        +-- yellow-brick-code
```

Once the directory is created, you will need to create the HTML file and the CSS file. The standard name for the initial HTML for any web site is `index.html`. Go ahead and `cd` into the `~/workspace/yellow-brick-code` directory and within, create the file with the following command.

```sh
touch index.html
```

Next, create a `styles` subdirectory and within, create a file named `main.css`.

Use `cd ..` to go up one directory level. Create another subdirectory named `scripts` and within, create a file named `main.js`.

Use `cd ..` to go up one directory level and create another subdirectory names `images`.

## Challenge: Creating Content in a File

> **NOTE:** Throughout the course, you will find Challenges and Advanced Challenges. These are completely optional exercises that you can choose to do. All we ask is that you complete all of the regular practice exercises before attempting to take on a challenge.
>
> If your instruction team has moved on to a new chapter or topics, it is far more important to work on the current practice exercises for the new topic than spending more time on a previous challenge.

During your career, you will be using powerful and extensible code editors like Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Webstorm, Eclipse, and many others to create your code. However, there are times when you want to enter a few lines of code, or a comment, into a file and you don't want to fire up the powerful editor.

Read the well-written answer to a [question on the Stack Exchange website](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/77277/how-to-append-multiple-lines-to-a-file) and see if you can figure out how to get the following CSS code into the `main.css` file without using Visual Studio Code. You will use the `echo` command instead.

```css
#fishtank {}

.fish {}

.fish__name {}
```

## Advanced Challenge: Terminal Welcome Message

> **NOTE:** Advanced challenges are only to be attempted once the practice exercises are complete and you feel you both (a) a solid grasp on the basic knowledge of the current topic, and (b) you have adequate time to devote to them. They are intended to be difficult to solve and you must spend time researching it before any instructor will offer guidance.

The terminal can do everything that all of your other applications can do. There's just not a visual interface for doing it. It's all text.

In this advanced challenge, you should research bash variables, bash aliases, and find out how to customize your `zsh` _(.zshrc)_ or `bash` _(.bashrc)_ initialization script to have a welcome message show up every time your launch a terminal session.
