# Update LinkedIn

LinkedIn has a feature that allows you to capture information about projects that you complete during your career.

Add your "Hello, World" group project to your profile. It should contain the following information.

* Name of project
* The date you started the group project
* The date you ended the group project
* The description field should list the purpose of the project, the list of technologies you used, and a personal anecdote about what you learned during the project.

#### Example Description

I built a project with 3 teammates that was a travel brochure application that let people who are interested in travlling to Indonesia, Morocco, Turkey, or Tanzania have a list of the best places to visit. This was our first group project at Nashville Software School, and we used HTML, CSS, Flexbox, JavaScript, Event Listeners, Git, Github, and `http-server` to build the website.

The most important lesson I learned during this group project was how important it is to plan your components, structure, layout, and modules before you start writing code. I also learned how git and Github can help a team work on a project together effectively.


# Update your Github Profile

[Kick Up Your Github](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/124u03j-d49Hh93gQZdh0I1Eq8ev8lQz6lXqODZytLJE/edit?usp=sharing)

Your Github profile allows you to customize pinned projects to your profile. You will `fork` this project into your account. Thus allowing you to pin it.

Be sure to complete the following:
1. `README.md` - Project name, description, how to run and technology, team members, wireframes, and your contribution.
2. Project Description - displays on the pinned item within Github
3. Set your contributions to allow tracking of private repos.
