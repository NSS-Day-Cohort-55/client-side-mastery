# Fundamental Workshops

A fundamental workshop is a place in the course where the instruction team will review the concepts that you've learned so far. In this workshop, you will be building several small applications that have the three components you learned about in Martin's Aquarium to converts raw data to HTML representations.

1. Data component
1. List component
1. HTML representation component

The team will provide you with a collection of data which you must import into a list component, and convert each item to an HTML representation, and then insert the HTML fragments into the DOM.

Some possible examples are:

* Flowers in a flower shop
* Products at a toy store
* Children in a classroom
* Animals at a kennel
* Customers at a bank
