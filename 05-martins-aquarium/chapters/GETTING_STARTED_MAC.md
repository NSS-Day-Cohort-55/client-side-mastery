# Getting Started

## Journal

Get a nice journal and a comfortable pen, and start keeping a daily journal of what you are learning every day. Writing your thoughts on a regular basis [increases your ability to remember it](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/writing-and-remembering-why-we-remember-what-we-write.html). There are even studies that found writing is [beneficial for your health](https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep01/keepdiary.aspx).

## Hardware

Up until now, you didn't have the power to destroy your machine, but within the first two weeks of attending Nashville Software School you will have that power. Go buy a backup drive _**RIGHT NOW**_ and start backing up your entire hard drive.

**Seriously, _right now!_**

## Online Services

### Github

Github is the primary site that software developers throughout the world use to store their code, and share it with other developers. Visit the [sign up page](https://github.com/join) and create your own, free account.

### dbdiagram.io

Sign up on [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) and bookmark the site.

### devdocs.io

Bookmark the [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/) site. It contains documentation for nearly everything you will be learning during your time here at NSS.

## Spectacle

_NOTE: If your Mac has an M1 ARM processor, install [Rectangle](#rectangle) instead._

This application will allow you to use certain combinations of keys on your keyboard to move and resize applications while you are developing.

[Download and install Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) and after it is installed, click on the link labeled _**keyboard shortcuts**_ on the web site to try it out.

## Homebrew

Visit the [homebrew home page](http://brew.sh/) and follow the single instruction there to get it installed.

#### Troubleshooting for instructors (don't try this yourself)

After installing Homebrew, you may get the following warning:

```
/opt/homebrew/bin is not in your PATH
```

This may be fixed with this command:

```
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is the editor we will all be working on to start the course. To install it, run the following command

```sh
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

## Command Line Launcher

Set up Visual Studio Code to be [launched from the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).


#### Troubleshooting for instructors (don't try this yourself)

If the `code` command still doesn't work, try adding this to `.zshrc` to update the path:

```sh
export PATH="\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
```

and if that doesn't work, set up a bash function in `.zshrc`

```sh
code () {
    if [[ $# = 0 ]]
    then
        open -a "Visual Studio Code"
    else
        [[ $1 = /* ]] && F="$1" || F="$PWD/${1#./}"
        open -a "Visual Studio Code" --args "$F"
    fi
}
```


## Google Chrome

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance.

## Node

Visit the [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) site and install the LTS release.

## Node Packages

Now that you have Node installed, you can install some open source software that you will need in the course.

Type the following in your terminal, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```sh
sudo npm i -g serve json-server
```

Make sure that `serve` was installed successfully.
Type the following in your terminal, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```sh
serve -v
```

If you see the message `command not found`, type the following in your terminal, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```sh
sudo npm i -g serve
```

Make sure that `json-server` was installed successfully.
Type the following in your terminal, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```sh
json-server -v
```

If you see the message `command not found`, type  the following in your terminal, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```sh
sudo npm i -g json-server
```

## Xcode Command Line Tools

Since you are going to be learning how to be a professional software developer, you will be using your computer terminal heavily. macOSX users need to install some baseline tools to use more advanced things later in the course.

Type this command into your terminal, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and then wait a while.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

## Git

Git is how you and your teammates will work on a shard codebase during your time at NSS. Type in the following command to install.

```sh
brew install git
brew install tig
```

### Configuring Git

Once Git is done being installed, watch the video on how to [set up global Git configuration](https://youtu.be/66EB9oxGMzQ) so that you can successfully back up your code to Github in a few days... once we show you how to do it.

### Handling Permission Issues After Setup

Sometimes, a student has permission issues after installing and configuring Git. To ensure that this doesn't happen to you, watch the [Owning Your Git Config Directory](https://youtu.be/exva3J_jojc) video and follow the steps.

## Oh My Zsh

1. If you haven't install Homebrew from the previous step, please complete that first.
1. Install zsh which is a powerful replacement for the standard bash terminal by typing the following command into the terminal

```sh
brew install zsh zsh-completions
```

1. Install [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) which is a framework for Z shell which makes the terminal a pleasure to work in. Use the following command.

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

1. Run the following command in Terminal application.

```sh
echo 'alias gs="git status"
alias hs="serve -l 8080"' >> ~/.zshrc
```


## Show Hidden Files

While you have your terminal open, enter in the following command.

```sh
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
```

This will allow you to view hidden files in the Finder app.

## SSH Key

SSH is a technology that allows you to create a very secure connection between your computer, and a computer located somewhere else in the world. It's an acronym for Secure SHell. When you create an SSH key on your computer, it actually creates two files

1. A public key file that you share with other people and computers. It is usually named `id_rsa.pub`.
1. A private key file that you never, ever, ever, ever, ever share with anyone. It is usually named `id_rsa`.

### Creating Your SSH Key

Watch a short video for [creating an SSH key in the terminal](https://youtu.be/znRMcNG9_qQ) so that you an work with Github.

### Add SSH Key to Github Account

Now watch the video for [adding your SSH key to your Github account](https://youtu.be/8hlmIObpMd4).

# Installations for Mac ARM Computers

## Rectangle <a name="rectangle"></a>
Rectangle is an open-source window management app based on Spectacle. Spectacle is no longer being supported and canâ€™t run natively on ARM.

This application will allow you to use certain combinations of keys on your keyboard to move and resize applications while you are developing.

Install from the command line:

```
brew install --cask rectangle
```

OR

[Download and install Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

For keyboard shortcuts and more information on how to use the app, you can view the [Rectangle Documentation](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle)
