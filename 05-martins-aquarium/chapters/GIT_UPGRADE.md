# UPGRADE GIT

The commands below are for upgrading git on your local machine if you do not have a version greater than 2.27.

### Mac Users

```$ brew install git```

Close your terminal and reopen, then check version.

```$ git --version```

### Windows Users

Here is the command to run in your terminal if you are on a Windows machine. (An installation window should appear when this is run and then you must go through the steps.)

```

Close your terminal and reopen, then check version.

```$ git --version```

If you were unable to upgrade your git to the latest version, let one of your instructors help you.
