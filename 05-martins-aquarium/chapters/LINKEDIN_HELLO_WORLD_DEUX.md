# Updating LinkedIn

Follow the [instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/43524/adding-and-editing-projects-on-your-profile?lang=en) for adding your "Automated World" group project to your profile. It should contain the following information.

* Name of project
* The date you started the group project
* The date you ended the group project
* The description field should list the purpose of the project, the list of technologies you used, and a personal anecdote about what you learned during the project.

#### Example Description

I built a project with 3 teammates that was a travel brochure application that let people who are interested in travlling to Indonesia, Morocco, Turkey, or Tanzania have a list of the best places to visit.

This was our second group project at Nashville Software School, and we used HTML, CSS, CSS Imports, Flexbox, JavaScript native modules, git, and Github to build the website. The entire application was designed to be component based where each component had a single responsibility.

The most important lesson I learned during this group project was how important it is to plan your components, structure, layout, and modules before you start writing code. I also learned how git and Github can help a team work on a project together effectively.
