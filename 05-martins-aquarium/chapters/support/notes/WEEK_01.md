# Week 1 Notes

## Day 1

o John Orientation at 9:00

o Start installations at 13:00

* Since I sent the install instructions to students 2 weeks before class started, installations went far more smoothly than ever before

## Day 2

o Cohort 40 demos at 9:15

o Sally's Interests at 13:30

* Gave students the rest of the afternoon to work on the exercises for using Flexbox for layout

## Day 3

o Flexbox lab time at 9:00

o Tell students to read chapter 3 at 11:05 ( master says 13:05 but video shows wireframing started at 11:30, not 13:30. Just changing here to remind us that the entire morning shouldn't be spent on flexbox lab time )

o Start wireframing Martin's Aquarium at 11:30

* I assigned students the task of reading chapter 3 - while referencing chapter 2 - and be prepared to offer their ideas about the discussion points in the chapter.
* After giving them 20 minutes to read and take notes, I started recording, and opened sketchboard.io.
* As a team discussion that was as student-led as possible, we decided where the content should appear on the page, which semantic tags should be used, and the BEM class names for each element. This took about 30 minutes.
* I used that wireframe to build out the basic HTML structure, and layout, of Martin's Aquarium. This took about 25 minutes. 
* ( Additionally took 1 hour, from 1:00 to 2:00 to continue the livecode with flexbox, adding images, modularizing CSS, and more )
* Before I pushed it up, I talked about git and Github. Showed them the command for branching, adding, committing, pushing up, and how to create pull requests. This took about 20 minutes.
* Then I sent them off on lab time to build their own Martin's Aquarium with mine as a reference.

## Day 4

o Lab time at 9:00 until 11:00

o Start Hello, World at 13:30

* At 11:00, Kristen, James and I took turns creating branches, submitting pull requests, checking pull requests, and merging code into master branch.
* After lunch, I told them they were going to start their first group project. I presented the "How to Plan" slide deck, shared it with them on Slack, and got them started via Github Classroom.

## Day 5

* Group project all day
