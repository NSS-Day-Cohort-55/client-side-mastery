# Week 2 Notes

## Day 1

o Group Project continued at 9:00

o Class demos at 14:00

* Gave them lab time for the rest of the day

## Day 2

o Foundations Course Assessment at 9:00

o Automating Martin's Aquarium at 9:45

* Gave them the assessment at 9:00. I phrased it as a survey. _"We are constantly trying to make the Foundations Course stronger for every cohort. I need you all to take this survey to see if it prepared you for what we are about to cover."_ They were all done in 15 minutes.
* I then reviewed the assessment when they were all done. This took 5-10 minutes.
* Then told them to go read chapter 8.
* At 9:45 I started live-coding chapter 8. Started with drawing a dependency graph of the Component Triad (provider, list, converter), and then coded the files.
* Kristen then live-coded chapters 9 and 10.
* We gave them several breaks during this process. No single coding session lasted longer than 45 minutes. Time box yourself and pay attention to the clock.
* At 14:00, we completed all the code, pushed it up, and I told them that the rest of the day was theirs to get their own automated aquarium site working, using ours as a reference.
* Told them that they could now work on Modern Farm, Daily Journal, and Dotard & Simbleton.

## Day 3

o Lab time at 9:00

o Show debugger at 13:30

* It was a lab day, with a brief interlude at 13:30 to show them the basics of using the Chrome debugger. This took ~35 minutes. I introduced all kinds of bugs that beginner's will often make with their code, then showed them how to use the debugger to track each of them down.
* Lab time the rest of the afternoon.

## Day 4

o Live code chapter 13 at 10:30

* Assigned students the task of reading chapter 13 at 9:00.
* Started live-coding at 10:30 and was done in 35 minutes.
* Lab time the rest of the day.

## Day 5

o Fundamental Workshop at 9:30

* Told students to push up whatever they had done so far to Github, and to be back in the main session at 9:30 for a Fundamental Workshop.
* Kristen and James took turns showing how to use the Component Triad to get data from a provider component into the list component, and use the converter component to change the objects into HTML. It was highly interactive and both of them prompted the students at every opportunity to tell them what to type.
* Lab time the rest of the day.

> **Personal Note:** My constant repetition of several key phrases/questions throughout the first 6 weeks are paying off. Students are immediately responding correctly to these. I recommend you start a similar strategy at this point in the course.
> * If a function returns a value, what should you do with that value?
> * Which array method is used to convert the items in the array to something else?
> * If I want to find all the items in an array that pass a certain condition, which method should I use?
> * If I want to find a single item in an array that passes a conditions, which method should I use?
