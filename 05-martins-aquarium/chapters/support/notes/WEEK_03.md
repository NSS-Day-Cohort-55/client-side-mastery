# Week 3 Notes

#### Personal Note

The new Foundations Course seems to have made a significant difference with this cohort. When I put a poll in their channel on Friday to see what specific concepts they wanted to cover, only one student voted for functions _(the one student who didn't do any pre-work)_.

Just like with cohorts 37 and 39, I've been using the terms Single Responsibility Principle, Object/HTML representations, and Components from day 1. Already the students are using that vernacular and have been asking clarifying questions about the concepts.

I have been encouraging them every day to work with each other because of the benefits of talking things out with other learners. Told them that I understand that sometimes you want some quiet alone time, but to push themselves out of their comfort zones and work together in breakout rooms. So far, very few people spend large amounts of time alone in their own rooms.

> **Note to other instructors:** Do not send students off on a group project without showing them how you would design something similar. Use sketchboard to make a wireframe, a dependency graph, and an event flow diagram _(once you get to custom events)_ for a small, example project.

## Day 1

o Review dependency graph at 9:00

o Automated World at 9:30

* To start the day, I opened sketchboard.io and did a wireframe and dependency graph for a coffee shop. The UI would display products, merchandise, and employees. Did this to show them how to plan Automated World as a team.
* Got them started on the project at 9:30
* We were all shocked to discover that every team was at MVP by mid-afternoon.
* Discussed streetch goals with them.

## Day 2

o Team retros at 13:00

* Let teams work on stretch goals until lunch.
* Retros at 13:30. All teams mentioned how they were more productive since they had the same teammates and already knew how to communicate and work together. Big love-fest.
* Had them fill out Group Project Feedback form.
* Lab time for the rest of the afternoon.

## Day 3

o Assign Clinic assessment via Github Classroom at 9:00

o Student 1:1s start at 9:30

o 1:1s completed at 13:30

* Lab time all day for assessment, one-on-ones, and any other project work they want to do once the assessment is complete.

## Day 4

### Beginning of Book 2

o Had students read chapter 1 and do the setup section at 9:00

o Had students read chapter 2 at 9:20

o Postman comprehensive demo at 9:30

o Getting officer data with `fetch()` at 10:00

o Assign students criminal display exercise at 10:45

o Populating conviction dropdown at 13:30

* Going to leave tomorrow as a lab day to encourage teams to form for Truncheons & Flagons. One team already formed today.

## Day 5

* Lab time all day

* Giving students the space to explore the projects, with nothing that HAD to be done, resulted in 4 more Truncheons & Flagons teams forming to create wireframes and dependency graphs, and also define the data structures that are needed for the application.
* At 14:30, I told them that the next couple chapters are going to introduce a new concept that will take a while to understand _(Custom Events)_ and that I wanted them to watch the Component Coupling YouTube video in chapter 4  before Monday.
