# Week 5 Notes

## Day 1

* Reminded students that they had to do their best to implement chapters 8 and 9 today.
* Lab time all day.
* At the end of the day, I told them I was trying something new. First thing in the morning, all three instructors would review their code for how they implemented Checking Alibis feature.

## Day 2

o Live-code chapter 8 at 9:00

o Awkward Photo Battle Royale between cohorts 41 and 42 at 13:00

o Start Holiday Road at 13:30

* After all three of us had shown how we implemented Alibis, I asked the students if it was helpful since I had never done that before. They all said yes, because listening to the three of us explain our thought process behind why we did what we did proved that there are multiple ways to solve something. It gave many of them confidence that just because they don't solve something the way I do, that's ok.
* Reviewed the How to Plan slide deck, and spent about 25 minutes in sketchboard.io doing wireframe, dependency graph, and event flow diagram for a small app about assigning tasks to people. A mini version of Holiday Road to prepare them for planning.
* Set them up for Holiday Road at 13:30. Told them that they had 5 days to do it.

## Day 3

o Holiday Road all day

* No stand-up on first day, but we did check in at 14:00 to check in on progress for design and planning and answer questions.
* Told Kristen and James that I wanted teams to learn how to use the Github Project board to created tasks and track them during the sprint. We coached all 6 teams on how to do it.
* We were **very** pleased to the see the amazing detail on their wireframes and event flow diagrams for the project. All teams were definitely set up for success implementing their designs.


## Day 4

o Holiday Road all day

* Did stand-ups between 9:15 - 9:30
* 3 of the 6 teams were nearly done with MVP by the end of the day.

## Day 5

o Holiday Road all day

* Did stand-ups between 9:15 - 9:30
