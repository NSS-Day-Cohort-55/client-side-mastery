# Week 6 Notes

## Day 1

o Holiday Road all day

* Told everyone that today was the last day of the project since most teams were already working on stretch goals.
* After lunch, I create the retro boards on all their repos and around 14:30, told them to start creating notes for their retro.

## Day 2

o Retros start at 9:10

o Second retros started around 9:45

o Class demos at 10:30

o Modular JavaScript Self-Assessment at 13:05

o Reviewed assessment questions at 15:30

* Since everyone had done an amazing job on their project, especially how much thought they put into customizing it for their chosen persona, I decided to have class demos so they all see what each team did.
* After demos, gave them the rest of morning for lab time. Was just over an hour for reflection and decompression.
* After lunch, told team that I was giving them a self-assessment and really emphasized that this was for them to assess their own level of understanding of the syntax and concepts so far.
* My plan is to have anyone who didn't perform well on the questions about fundamentals to do the assessment again so I could see, in further detail, where they were weak. No one performed poorly, which was encouraging.

## Day 3

o ERD and data relationships at 9:20

o Joining related objects in JavaScript _(chapter 12)_ at 10:25

o Kristen further ERD planning at 13:00

o 1:1 start at 13:45

o Meet their little sibs at 15:30

* Started by stating that the goal of the the code for today is so that when a detective records a note, she can specify the criminal that the note is about. The name of the criminal should come from the API, and should not be typed by the detective. Thus, we need a foreign key called `criminalId`.
* ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Make a point to tell students that data relationships is the most important technical learning objective at NSS ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
* Polled students to see if eveyone had watched the videos in the chapter. Not everyone had. I told everyone who had not watched them to go do it now.
* About 30 minutes later, I fired up dbdiagram.io and copy pasta the table definitions from the chapter. Gave a vocabulary review.
    1. Collections of data in a database are called tables.
    1. Fields define the specific pieces of data we want to collect about a resource.
    1. Each entry in a table is called a record.
    1. Referenced everything back to arrays, objects, and properties that they are using in their `database.json` file.
* Then contrived an example about an application we need to write for a nurse to record patients that come into a hospital for a doctor visit.
    1. Doctors table
    1. Patients table
    1. Hospitals table
    1. Employees table
* Talked at length about primary key/foreign key relationships.
* Once I was done live coding, I told students that it was their job to review chapter 13 and try to get it working before I live code it tomorrow.
* Then implemented how that data would look in an example `patienttracker.json` file with an array for each table, a few records with all the properties that were defined as fields in the diagram.
* Kristen then had the students drive another ERD based on a contrived example of keeping track of a sports league at 13:00.
* In the 1:1 meetings, I opened the conversation with _"So now that you have taken your 2nd self-assessment, how are you feeling about your progress so far."_ This does two things.
    1. It puts them in control of the coversation, which lowers their walls and allows them to be honest and candid.
    2. It lets them know that it truly was a self-assessment and was not being used by me as a tool for judgement. This is a long play you are setting up by doing this. Students will eventually feel that their learning is 100% under their control, and that the assessments are not to be feared, but rather valuable tools for them to utilize.

## Day 4

o Live code chapter 13 at 9:00

* Live coded chapter 13 first thing, and wow, what a difference it made assigning them to try it first yesterday. Instead of me talking about low level concepts and syntax, they were very active and engaged asking high level questions and offering differing opinions based on how they implemented it.
* Lab day the rest of the day
