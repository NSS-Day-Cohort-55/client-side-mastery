# Week 7 Notes

## Day 1

o Live code deleting notes at 9:00

* Live coding took ~15 minutes.
* Discussion of implementation, alternative approaches, and answering questions took another 15.
* Class discussions are definitely getting lively. Most students are clearly able to Analyze and Evaluate the code I wrote, and we discussed pros and cons of different ideas.

## Day 2

o Lab day

* Told students to read the criminal facilities chapter and implement if they could.

## Day 3

o Many to many at 9:00

o Criminal Facilities at 14:30

* I started with ERD for criminal facilities in dbdiagram.
* Then walked the class through the chapter code, which I had already implemeted locally. I could do this because I had asked them to review the chapter yesterday, which they clearly had.
* In this chapter code, I formally introduce them to component state, even though I had hinted at it in earlier chapters/code. Told them it was time to expand their understanding of state in preparation for React.
* My constant repetition of key phrases throughout the first 6 weeks are paying off. Students are immediately responding correctly to..
    * If a function returns a value, what should you do with that value?
    * Which array method is used to convert the items in the array to something else?
    * If I want to find all the items in an array that pass a certain condition, which method should I use?
    * If I want to find a single item in an array that passes a conditions, which method should I use?

## Day 4

o Filter by crime and officer at 9:20

* Entire session took ~45 minutes.
* I was going to give the students a full lab day, but they insisted that we do a live-coding session instead. They wanted to know how to get the criminal list filtered by **both** the crime and the arresting officer at the same time.
* I started the session by verbally describing the logic of the process but didn't write any code. I did frame the conversation around the possibility of using component-level state variables for the solution.
* Students provided 90% of the ideas, and I just coded what they wanted. I did give them gentle nudges here and there, but they largely implemented it themselves.

## Day 5

o Lab day

* ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We celebrated the very first successful implementation of Truncheons & Flagons by a student team today!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
* During the walkabout to all the breakout rooms, I discovered to my pleasure that a 6 other students had completed one, or more, of the data relationships projects in Book 3. It was truly impressive.
