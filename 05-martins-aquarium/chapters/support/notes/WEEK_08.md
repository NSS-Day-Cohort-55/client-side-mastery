# Week 8 Notes

## Day 1

o Lab day

- Had another T&F team demo their completed project!!

## Day 2

o Nutshell begins

- Added more tickets for stretch goals
- Gave each time a community to target for the experience
    * Dog Show Enthusiasts
    * Lawn Artists
    * Alien Abductee Support Group
    * Lizard Collectors
    * Romance Novelists
    * Broadway Performers
- Required teams to break down the epic feature tickets into smaller, technical tickets required to complete each feature
- They could not start coding until their assigned instructor approved their tickets
- Make sure you tell them that breaking down into technical tickets will encourage them to submit more PRs instead of waiting until the end of the spring to submit one, giant PR for a teammate to approve.
- Make sure they do ERD, wireframe, and event flow diagram before starting.
