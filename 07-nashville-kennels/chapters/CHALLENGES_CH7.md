# Challenges for Ch 7: More Routes

All routes (animals, locations, employees and customers) for chapter 7 need to be completed before you attempt this chapter.  

This challenge is for anyone who feels that routing hasn't set in yet and wants to practice more.

1. Add the `/about` route.  This route should render a component named `About`.  The contents of about are up to you, but should minimally be `<h2>About Nashville Kennels</h2>`.
Make sure you have a way users can access this route from the Home page.  It can be through the nav bar or a button.
1. Add the `/careers` route. This route should render a component named `Careers`.  The contents of about are up to you, but should minimally be `<h2>Open Positions at Nashville Kennels</h2>`.  Make sure you have a way users can access this route from the Home page.  It can be through the nav bar or a button.
