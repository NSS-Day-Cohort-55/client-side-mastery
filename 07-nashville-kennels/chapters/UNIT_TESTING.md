# Automated Testing of Functional Units

## What is a Functional Unit?

Imagine that you have written an application that helps a doctor's office manage patient appointments and prescription information. Here's a list of possible functionality that the application would have.

1. Add a new patient into the system
1. List all patients
1. Search for a specific patient
1. Add a new doctor into the system
1. List all doctors
1. Search for a specific doctor
1. Schedule a patient appointment with a doctor
1. Enter in a doctor's prescription for a patient

This is the basic functionality of the system. Each one of these is a functional unit, or feature, that you need to write tests for. The purpose of the tests are to ensure that each feature works as intended before any code gets released to production.

Unit tests are also a fantastic way to document your code. In a software application that is orders of magnitude more complex that your simple doctor's office program, it becomes impossible to understand the system simply by reading the code.

Reading through, and running, the unit tests allows a new developer to understand how the system should operate, and then explore the code related to each feature.

## Testing JavaScript with Jasmine

[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is a popular tool that JavaScript developers use to write tests to validate that their code works as intended.
