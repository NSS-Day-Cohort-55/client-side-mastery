# Add a Readme To Your Project

You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

README files typically include information on:

* What the project does
* Why the project is useful
* How users can get started with the project
* Where users can get help with your project
* Who maintains and contributes to the project

Other things you may want to include are:
* ERD image
* image of finished product
